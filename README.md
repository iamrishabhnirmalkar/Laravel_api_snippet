## Setup Laravel

### About

Laravel is a powerful PHP backend framework. This setup guide is for Laravel version 11. Ensure you check the version of Laravel you are using, as steps may vary with different versions.

Initialize a Laravel Project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel project_name
```

Initialize Laravel API:

```bash
php artisan install:api
```

This command sets up the Laravel project with API routes. You can find the API routes in the `routes/api.php` file, where you will define the endpoints for your REST API.
